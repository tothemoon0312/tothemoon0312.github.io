										<h2 class="major">Digital SLR cameras explained: 1. Why Single Lens Reflex?</h2>
										<p>The name single lens reflex camera seems rather odd today, but there was a time when twin lens reflex (TLR) cameras were very popular – there are still one or two models on sale today.

The two lenses of an TLR have the same focal length and their focusing mechanisms are linked, but they are used for two different tasks.

The ‘viewing lens’ is used for focusing while the photographer looks in the waist-level viewfinder, while the ‘taking lens’ sits in front of the film, ready for exposure in a separate chamber.

The word ‘reflex’ in the name stems from the fact that TLR and SLR cameras have a reflex mirror, essentially a mirror at 45 degrees, that reflects light from the lens into the viewfinder.

In a TLR the mirror is fixed and the scene is visible in the viewfinder throughout the exposure.

In a digital SLR camera, however, the mirror flips up during exposure to allow the light to reach the film or sensor, this blanks out the viewfinder for the duration of the exposure.

										<h2 class="major">compact cameras</h2>
										<p>Point-and-shoot cameras are distinguished from single-lens reflex cameras (SLRs) in several respects: point-and-shoot film cameras, and many digital ones, use a viewfinder. The image that the photographer sees is not the same image that passes through the primary lens of the camera (that is, the lens that projects the image onto the film or, in the case of digital cameras, the image sensor). Rather, the image in the viewfinder passes through a separate lens.[3] SLRs, on the other hand, have only one lens, and a mirror diverts the image from the lens into the viewfinder; that mirror then retracts when the picture is taken so that the image can be recorded on the film or sensor. With this mechanism, pictures cannot be previewed on the LCD screens of most digital SLRs, although some manufacturers have found a way around this limitation. Digital cameras eliminate one advantage of the SLR design, as the camera's display image comes through the lens, not a separate viewfinder. Many smaller digital point-and-shoots of the 2010s omit the optical viewfinder..</p>

										<h2 class="major">Film vs. Digital: A Comparison of the Advantages and Disadvantages </h2>
										<p>In a world in which photographs are primarily taken with digital image sensors, there are a growing number of photographers who are newly interested in film formats of the past. But why would anyone in our age of technological convenience still choose to shoot with analog film?

To understand the advantages and disadvantages of each shooting practice, we are comparing the different aspects of each’s image quality, along with the cost of usage. If you have been thinking of tinkering with film photography, you have landed in the right place

											<h3 class="major">what is shutter speed:</h3>
											<p>Shutter speed, also known as “exposure time”, stands for the length of time a camera shutter is open to expose light into the camera sensor. If the shutter speed is fast, it can help to freeze action completely, as seen in the above photo of the dolphin. If the shutter speed is slow, it can create an effect called “motion blur”, where moving objects appear blurred along the direction of the motion. This effect is used quite a bit in advertisements of cars and motorbikes, where a sense of speed and motion is communicated to the viewer by intentionally blurring the moving wheels.</p>

											<h3 class="major">The Focal Length</h3>
											<p>A primary characteristic of a lens is the focal length. A lens’ focal length is defined as the distance between the lens’ optical center and the camera’s image sensor (or film plane) when focused at infinity. To understand this definition of focal length, we need to define “optical center” as well. A lens’ optical center is the point (usually though not always) within a lens, at which the rays of light from two different sources entering the lens are assumed to cross. Shorter focal length lenses provide a wider field of view, but offer less magnification. Conversely, longer focal lengths offer a shorter field of view, but provide greater magnification. On DSLRs, the interchangeable lens’ focal length is measured in millimeters. The focal length of a lens is usually displayed on the lens barrel, along with the size of the adaptor ring.</p>																					</article>

											<h3 class="major"> what is flash?</h3>
											<p>Most built-in flashes are also located near the camera lens, which can often result in the red-eye effect  when photographing subjects in dimly lit conditions. Red-eye occurs because pupils dilate in dim light, the built-in flash is aligned with the lens's optical axis, its beam enters the eye and reflects back at the camera from the retina at the rear of the eye, which is quite red. Being able to use an on-camera flash source off-camera, from a different angle, will help to eliminate the red-eye effect in your photographs of people.</p>

											<h3 class="major">try Using Your Camera's "P" Program Mode</h3>
											<p>Just because you have a camera that has manual setting functions 
doesn't mean you have to fumble with them all the time. The P mode 
allows you to retain control over all camera functions, but the Shutter 
Speed and Aperture settings will be taken care of by the camera.</p>
