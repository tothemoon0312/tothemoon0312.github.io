										<h2 class="major">JUST ADD WATER </h2>
										<p>If you’re looking for that little extra something to push your flower photography over the top, this might just be it.  It’s such a simple and small thing, but I think it really adds drama and interest.  ‘What possibly could it be,’ you may ask.  As the title of this tip implies, just add water.  If you’re out shooting shortly after a rain shower or early in the morning when there is dew on the flowers, it’s already been done for you.  However, if you need to add your own, a small spray bottle will suffice.  Just spritz a little bit of water on the flower, and then take your best shot.  This water will accomplish three things for you in preparation for some great images.  First, the flower may be dusty and the water will clean it off.  Secondly, the water will bead up on the flower petals and other flower parts and just makes the image much more interesting.  Finally, the flower will glisten as light is reflected off the sheen of water and make it appear more vibrant in your images.  Give it a try…it’s a simple technique that could make a huge difference.

										<h2 class="major">PAINT WITH LIGHT
</h2>
										<p>Point-and-shoot cameras are distinguished from single-lens reflex cameras (SLRs) in several respects: point-and-shoot film cameras, and many digital ones, use a viewfinder. The image that the photographer sees is not the same image that passes through the primary lens of the camera (that is, the lens that projects the image onto the film or, in the case of digital cameras, the image sensor). Rather, the image in the viewfinder passes through a separate lens.[3] SLRs, on the other hand, have only one lens, and a mirror diverts the image from the lens into the viewfinder; that mirror then retracts when the picture is taken so that the image can be recorded on the film or sensor. With this mechanism, pictures cannot be previewed on the LCD screens of most digital SLRs, although some manufacturers have found a way around this limitation. Digital cameras eliminate one advantage of the SLR design, as the camera's display image comes through the lens, not a separate viewfinder. Many smaller digital point-and-shoots of the 2010s omit the optical viewfinder..</p>

										<h2 class="major">THINK (AND SHOOT) OUTSIDE THE box </h2>
										<p>In a world in which photographs are primarily taken with digital image sensors, there are a growing number of photographers who are newly interested in film formats of the past. But why would anyone in our age of technological convenience still choose to shoot with analog film?

To understand the advantages and disadvantages of each shooting practice, we are comparing the different aspects of each’s image quality, along with the cost of usage. If you have been thinking of tinkering with film photography, you have landed in the right place

											<h3 class="major">show some movement</h3>
											<p>Just because the wind is blowing that field of wildflowers doesn’t mean that you have to set up a wind block and attempt to shoot a stationary subject.  Try using the wind to your advantage in making a more creative image of the flowers.  With the camera set up on a tripod, stop down the aperture to achieve a relatively slow shutter speed.  Depending on how strong the wind is blowing and how much light is available, you may even need to use a neutral density filter to slow the shutter speed enough to show movement.  Once you have established the camera setting necessary for the shot, make an image and review it on the LCD.  Make adjustments, if necessary, to speed up or slow down the shutter speed for the desired result.  The shutter should remain open for a second or two as the wind is blowing the flowers.  The result will be a more artistic and dynamic image showing the blurring of the flowers as they move to and fro. .</p>

											<h3 class="major">HAVE FUN WITH THE SUN</h3>
											<p>Ideally, you will be making images close to sunrise or sunset when the sun is low in the sky and the light is best.  Place the flower between the camera and the sun, with just a hint of the sun peeking out from the edge of the flower to create a starburst effect.  This will require the lens aperture to be small, in the neighborhood of f/16 or f/22.  Be sure use a tripod and use live view to compose and focus.  Do not look directly toward the sun through the viewfinder, as this could damage your eye.  Also, take advantage of the beautiful colors in the sky just as the sun is about to rise or right after sunset.  Compose the image of the flower to show the setting sun and sky to make a very dramatic image.

											<h3 class="major"> SHOW THE FLOWER’S LIFE CYCLE </h3>
											<p>One great way to tell a story with your flower images is to select a flower and show its life cycle with a series of images taken throughout the growing season.  Preferably, use a flower in your backyard garden so you will have easy access and won’t have to travel anywhere.  Start with an initial image showing the flower just as it is planted or beginning to grow.  Over time, take an image every few days or a week to illustrate the transformation of the flower as it begins to bloom, fully opens, and eventually dies at the end of its life cycle or when the weather changes.  Depending on the number of images taken, you may even be able to put them together to create a time-lapse video of your flower.

											<h3 class="major">try Using Your Camera's "P" Program Mode</h3>
											<p>Just because you have a camera that has manual setting functions 
doesn't mean you have to fumble with them all the time. The P mode 
allows you to retain control over all camera functions, but the Shutter 
Speed and Aperture settings will be taken care of by the camera.</p>
